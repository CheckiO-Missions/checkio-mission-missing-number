            üí° For the solution I offer you, the idea is the following. Since the difference between every two adjacent numbers in the arithmetic progression is constant, you need to check every three elements in the sorted initial list and find the "gap" - where the differences between elements in two adjacent pairs in a triplet are not equal.

            To perform the idea, your list should be sorted. Make in-place sorting with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_sort.asp">sort()</a> list method.

        <pre class="brush: python">

            How to get every three adjacent elements of the list?

        <p>
            Using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp">for loop</a>, iterate over the elements of the list, taking their indexes from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_range.asp">range()</a> function.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
for i in range(...):
    ...
        </pre>
        <p>
            Since you are going to work with three adjacent elements inside loop and in order to avoid generating indexes, which are out of the list, you need to iterate not to the very end of the list, but two elements less.
        </p>
        <p>
            How to do so? You need to find the length of the list with built-in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_len.asp">len()</a> function and subtract <b class="code">2</b> from it. Use the result as an argument of <b class="code">range()</b>.

            To make your solution more readable, let's create three variables <b class="code">f</b>irst, <b class="code">s</b>econd and <b class="code">t</b>hird. Use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples_unpack.asp">unpacking</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://railsware.com/blog/python-for-machine-learning-indexing-and-slicing-for-lists-tuples-strings-and-other-sequential-types/">slicing</a> to assign values of three adjacent elements from the list to the variables.

        <p>
            Well, it's ease. Using <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html">if statement</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp">not equal (!=)</a> operator, compare differences between two pairs of variables.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
if t - s != s - f:
    ...
        </pre>
        <p>
            Our list is sorted ascending (first element among three is the smallest, third - biggest), so both differences are positive.

        <p>
            How to find the missing element?
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            If the previous condition is <b class="code">True</b> (the "gap" is found), you need to subtract the difference <b class="code">s - f</b> from <b class="code">t</b>.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
t - (s - f)
        </pre>
        <p>
            So, why does it work? For example, you have a sorted list <b class="code">[1, 2, 4]</b>. If you subtract from <b class="code">4</b> "normal" step for this progression <b class="code">2 - 1 == 1</b>, you receive a correct answer <b class="code">4 - 1 == 3</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            But it also works, if the "gap" is between second and first elements! You have a list <b class="code">[1, 3, 4]</b>. If you make necessary subtractions - <b class="code">4 - (3 - 1) == 4 - 2 == 2</b>, you receive a correct answer again!  
        </p>

        <p>So, how my final solution should look like?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            You just need to wrap your code into function expression, join all statements above and return the result of the last expression with subtractions. 
        </p>
        <p>Here is the whole solution:</p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def missing_number(items: list[int]) -> int:

    items.sort()
    for i in range(len(items) - 2):
        f, s, t = items[i: i + 3]
        if t - s != s - f:
            return t - (s - f)
        </pre>

    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Sure, grab it!</p>
        <p>
            In this solution you find the step and iterate over the correct progression. If an element of the progression is not present in the initial list - it's the answer.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def missing_number(items: list[int]) -> int:

    first, *_, last = sorted(items)
    step = (last - first) // len(items)
    for i in range(first+step, last, step):
        if i not in items:
            return i
        </pre>
        <p>
            The sum of some number of elements of progression may be counted by the formula. So the difference between this sum and the sum of elements of the initial list is the missing element. 
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
def missing_number(items: List[int]) -> int:   

    first, *_, last = sorted(items)
    total = (first + last) * (len(items) + 1) // 2

    return total - sum(items)
